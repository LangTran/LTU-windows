## LangTran Updade method for Windows
These scripts depend on the [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) version of _rsync_ to keep a software repository on your local computer up-to-date, and in sync with the international repository of the [LangTran Software Distribution System](http://lingtransoft.info/apps/langtran).

The packaging is as a _.exe_ file for the Windows platform, and includes files from Cygwin that are needed for the scripts to run.
